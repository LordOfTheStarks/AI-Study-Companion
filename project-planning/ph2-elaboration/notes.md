## Documentation

In the config file for doxygen it mentions .py as one of the file types it looks for so we should be able to use it for the python code. Although I dont think python supports comments that use /*/ so you would need to use the comments that use """ """. It would be a good idea to ask everyone to add one of these comments to all the code they write just so we have the documentation as it is being worked on and dont need to go back and do all of it.
